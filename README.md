# rizzgpt
AI tool that helps you get laid

So... do you find yourself in an awkward position when talking to the opposite gender?
Hahaha don't worry, introducing, RIZZGPT!

So to use RizzGPT, firstly you have to clone this repo.

Then, since RizzGPT uses the gradio library, you have to install the library first if you have yet to.

To do this, run this command in your terminal:
```
pip install gradio
```
Next, since RizzGPT also uses OpenAI's API, make sure to get your OpenAI API key and paste it in line 4, where it says

```
"insert-your-api-key-here-lol"
```

You're good to go! Run this file and in the terminal you will see a link where RizzGPT is hosted locally on your device.

Follow that link and you can now use RizzGPT yeay!
